IKEv2 AUTH test. The certs are valid but both ends use an
explicit ID, not the cert ID. These IDs may only be trusted
if they appear as subjectAltName (SAN) on the certificate.

Since the IP used as ID is not an IP on the SAN, the connection
should fail


Since east fails, this test does not verify west would fail. This
test really needs a -responder version too.
