East has a certificate that is not yet valid, west attempts to connect to
east. This connection should fail.

Oddly enough, NSS tells us "Peer's Certificate has expired" instead of telling
us "not yet valid".

Also, west's whack isn't getting released after this error, which seems odd,
since we used --impair-retransmits and it should just fail fully.
