basic OE test triggered by whack (not a packet) using mutual CERT AUTH

The test sets retransmit-interval=2000 to prevent retransmits
from interfering with the reference output.

West has put in east in "private-or-clear", so the whack command
shows that this is the right foodgroup being hit:

"private-or-clear#192.1.2.0/24"
