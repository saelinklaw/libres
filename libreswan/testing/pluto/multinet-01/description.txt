This is a test case for the "subnets=" declaration.

Pluto doesn't really understand multiple subnets, and IKE can't really
negotiate it.  However, the following does occur.

1) subnets= generates a set of policies. So, this is a processing time
   "macro", if you wish.

2) each policy is given an "alias", and if one --up's an alias, then all
   connections with that alias are brought up (or down).


It tests the two types of syntax allowed by using one type on east and
one type on west.

The IKE SA is shared, and ideally should be deleted when the last IPsec SA
is deleted. But it is not. This is not a big problem as it will go away
on its own later.
