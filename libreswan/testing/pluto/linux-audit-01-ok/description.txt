NETKEY based test to verify AUDIT messages are logged by the kernel
for service startup and shutdown and IKE SA's and IPSEC SA's events.

This test MUST run with selinux enabled or else the selinux labels in
the audit log are different (eg unconfined). Since some have configured
test VMs with /etc/sysconfig/selinux disabled, force it in this test.

This test should only show op=start|destroy and res=success messages.

See linux-audit-02-fail for the tests on failure messages
