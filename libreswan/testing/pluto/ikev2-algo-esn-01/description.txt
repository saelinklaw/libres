Test of negotiating ESN with netkey

The test for this is difficult, it technically requires 2^32 packets to trigger.
But a side effect of setting esn=yes is that the kernel xfrm state no longer
uses the main replay_window header option, but a new struct. So it will display
a replay_window of 0 (irrespective of the real replay_window)
