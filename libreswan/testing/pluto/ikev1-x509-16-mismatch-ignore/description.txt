IKEv1 auth test. The certs are valid but both ends use an explicit ID,
not the cert ID. These IDs are normally only trusted if they appear
as subjectAltName (SAN) on the certificate. But since both ends now
specify leftid=/rightid=%any, the IKE ID's are completely ignored and
the other endpoint only needs to present a certificate that is verified
to be signed by the proper CA.
