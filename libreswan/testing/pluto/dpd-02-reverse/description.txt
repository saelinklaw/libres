This tests the RFC3706 DPD implementation, ensuring we only enable it
when both sides support it. Note that we don't have a way for _not_ supporting
or announcing it. So west and east support DPD, but only WEST activates it. So
only probes from west to east (and their replies) should happen. East should
not send out R_U_THERE requests.
