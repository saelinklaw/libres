IKEv2 responder fetch initiator key role over with two connections.

east, the responder, does not initiator's public key locally.
When AUTH exchange message arrives with IDi=road.testing.libreswan.org,
east fetches the ipseckey RR for IDi and adds it to pluto's global keystore.
And continue with authentication.

Road publishes two IPSECKEYs in DNS.
Road brings up first connection. It should establish and ping.

Road restarts and another with the new key.
Brings up second connection since east has both keys from DNS it will establish.

Road, the initiator, has east's publickey locally configured.
Note final.sh has ipsec auto --listpubkeys and east has road's key.

ipsec is restart and road to ensure we are really using the one key we
want to test without having both keys loaded
