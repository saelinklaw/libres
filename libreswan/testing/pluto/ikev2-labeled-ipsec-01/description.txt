basic-pluto-01 but now with labeled IPsec using NETKEY. A test on port 4300
using netcat and getpeercon_server to confirm traffic flow and label.

(requires private getpeercon package, we'll include it as source in /testing soon)

A shutdown is issued to verify no kernel state is left behind

This needs updating to must use netutils_t type for both ncat server
and client (via runcon -t), I did not find a better context type than
this. Also you need to switch nis_enabled and domain_can_mmap_file
selinux boolean on to make it work.
