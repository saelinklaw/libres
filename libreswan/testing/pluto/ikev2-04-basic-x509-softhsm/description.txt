This test blows away all the softhsm tokens on the system. USE WITH CARE


Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.
It uses certificates

Now the east certificate is not coming from the native NSS store, but from
another PKCS#11 provider (softhsm) - like a hardware token

This test is currently not finding the rightcert= on east


Note: I wonder if we need to parse the rightcert= value not as a CKAID, but
as a token name, perhaps using pk11_MatchSlotByTokenURI() first, and then
matching the CKAID (which eastinit.sh sets to "01" for the east certificate).
