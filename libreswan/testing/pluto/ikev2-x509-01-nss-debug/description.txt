Running with NSS debugging. This requires rebuild nss
packages with BUILD_OPT unset in the spec file.

You can find those for f28/f29 at https://nohats.ca/nss/

This test also sets all known maybe related environment variables supported,
which also activate the nss debug logging, and throw it to console to see.

nss statistics are printed. deep detailed call logs are in the *.console.verbose.txt logs
(since they have pointers, etc, we dont want to sanitizer)

Test not added to TESTLIST because it requires recompiled nss and probably has some ephemeral data in output
