Same as ikev2-dcookie-01 but now west uses an impair to send a mangled dcookie
and east is NOT in busy mode so it does not expect to receive a DCOOKIE.

Contrary to the RFC, we _do_ process and validate the dcookie.

The connection should fail. Note this testcase cannot be sped up using
impair-rentransmits because cookies rely on the retransmit.
