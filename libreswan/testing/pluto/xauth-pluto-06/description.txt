This test has a road warrior, ("road") connecting to VPN host east.

It shows up from a random IP.

It uses PSK to authenticate for phase 1.
It uses aggressive mode.
It then uses XAUTH to authenticate the phase 1.5.
It then uses MODECFG to configure the phase 2.

It then proceeds to phase 2.
It has PFS=yes for phase 2. (and this is the only difference with xauth-pluto-05)


Paul: Since not specifying pfs means pfs=yes, this test is identical to xauth-pluto-05
