Basic pluto with IKEv2 using PSK with libreswan on the initiator (west), and openbsd on the responder.

This is not meant (yet) to run automatically

opnbsd must have the iked package installed (openiked)

On openbsd, this will look like:

openbsd# ipsecctl -s all
FLOWS:
flow esp in from 192.0.2.0/24 to 192.0.1.0/24 peer 192.1.2.23 srcid FQDN/west dstid FQDN/east type use
flow esp out from 192.0.1.0/24 to 192.0.2.0/24 peer 192.1.2.23 srcid FQDN/west dstid FQDN/east type require
flow esp out from ::/0 to ::/0 type deny

SAD:
esp tunnel from 192.1.2.23 to 192.1.2.45 spi 0x351977b3 auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256
esp tunnel from 192.1.2.45 to 192.1.2.23 spi 0x531511aa auth hmac-sha2-256 enc aes-256


note it seems openbsd does not properly support an ipv4 and ipv6 tunnel using the same IKE SA
