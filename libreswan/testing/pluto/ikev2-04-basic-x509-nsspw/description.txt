Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.
It uses certificates

This also tests having public keys loaded from certificates, but not
use the DN as the ID.  Pluto also loads the public key in the certificate
file with the name given.

This test does not use or reply on any CA cert.

This is called "out of bound PKIX", as the certificates are not sent
in-band.
