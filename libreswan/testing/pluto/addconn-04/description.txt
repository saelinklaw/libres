Testing of non-standard ipsec.conf passed to pluto

In versions prior to 3.30, starting pluto using ipsec pluto --config /dir/ipsec.conf
would cause the pluto main process to start addconn without passing
the --config /dir/ipsec.conf option and any connections meant to be loaded
on startup would not load.

Additionally, ipsec status would display that /etc/ipsec.conf was used instead
of /dir/ipsec.conf

This also tests another bug, rhbz#1645137 that caused addconn to cras
on extremely long ike= lines (from systemwide crypto policies)
