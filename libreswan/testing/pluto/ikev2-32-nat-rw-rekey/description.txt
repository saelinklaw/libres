IKEv2 RW test with rekey=no and dpdaction clear on the responder,east.
rekey=yes on initiator, rod. ikelifetime 80s.  East will clear with dpd action.


The initiator is behind NAT.
1. Road initiates and establish connection.
2. Road block traffic to east.
3. East hit liveness clear and clears the connection , do not retry.
4. Initiator keeps the tunnel up.
4. initiator ike expires and rekey/reauthenticate, brings up the tunnel.


Issue: recent libreswan's with revival code try to re-use the IKE SA to send a CREATE_CHILD_SA
that east answers incorrectly:

"road-east-x509-ipv4"[1] 192.1.2.23 #7: missing v2CP reply, not attempting to setup child SA

This indicates a few bugs interacting with each other
