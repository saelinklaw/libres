as newoe-18-clear-block but now road has east's /24 clear
but east's /32 in block. ping should fail

currently this test is failing. The /24 clear policy is

src 192.1.2.0/24 dst 192.1.3.209/32
        dir fwd priority 1576 ptype main
src 192.1.2.0/24 dst 192.1.3.209/32
        dir in priority 1576 ptype main

and the block policy is

src 192.1.2.23/32 dst 192.1.3.209/32
        dir fwd action block priority 2080 ptype main
src 192.1.2.23/32 dst 192.1.3.209/32
        dir in action block priority 2080 ptype main
src 192.1.3.209/32 dst 192.1.2.23/32
        dir out action block priority 2080 ptype main

So the clear policy mistakenly wins despite the block having a longer prefix

Manually setting this will cause failure for the reverse test case
