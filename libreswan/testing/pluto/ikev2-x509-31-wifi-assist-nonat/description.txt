Wifi assist test case where road has a wifi and lte connection
up with each conn getting its own IP address.

Compared to ikev2-x509-31-wifi-assist this is a more realistic
test, as the LTE and WIFI device show up as two different IPs
to east - whether those two are real or NAT'ed should not really
matter.
