Bug 339: delete the cert in the NSS DB while pluto is trying to use it.

- check that, provided pluto has no references, a deleted certificate
  doesn't appear in the certificate list

  a certificate leak in add_connection() meant it did still get listed

- be prepared for a cert extraction to fail, and when it does, dump
  the connection

  better than a core dump
