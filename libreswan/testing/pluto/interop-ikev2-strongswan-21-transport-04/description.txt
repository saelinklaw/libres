This tests a mismatch of transport vs tunnel mode.

The RFC says that if transport is not supported, tunnel should be used.

libreswan refuses to use tunnel mode when transport mode is configured, to
avoid connections that work only when one specific side is the initiator.

However, strongswan follows the rfc and will install tunnel mode when it
has transport mode configured.

This is the reverse test of interop-ikev2-strongswan-21-transport-03

NOTE: since we cannot timeout the strongswan failing up command, this
testcase might have text flow issues and cause a false positive
