basic OE test, using road and east triggered by packet using NETKEY on road

This test has policies so that east has road in clear-or-private, and road
has east in private-or-clear, so one clean OE connection happens even after
restart.

This test uses ping's redirected to /dev/null and an sed line on the traffic
status so prevent false positives depending on timing/ping/packetloss during
acquires.
