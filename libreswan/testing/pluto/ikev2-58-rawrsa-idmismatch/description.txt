Mismatched ID and connection should fail to establish.
Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder,
using RAW RSA keys for authentication.
West use IDi as west.  East has no leftid configured, it will default to IPv4
and fail to establish the first connection west-westnet-eastnet.

Then delete the first connection, the public keys are left around.
Add and initiate new connection with east-westnet-eastnet.
Now there will be 3 public keys.

West's key is twice one with IP address as ID and another with west.
