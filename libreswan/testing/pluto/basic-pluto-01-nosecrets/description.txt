ikev1 test with keyid+rsasigkey+raw key

This is kind of the converse of ikev2-03-basic-rawrsa-ckaid.

- the NSS db contains west's raw private key

- a connection specifying:
  -- east/west's IDs
  -- east/west's RSASIGKEY (i.e., raw signatures)
  is loaded.

- trying to up the connection fails because the private key can't be
  found:

| looking connection westnet-eastnet's RSA private key
| lsw_get_secret() using IDs for @west->@east of kind PKK_RSA
| concluding with best_match=000 best=(nil) (lineno=-1)
| connection westnet-eastnet's RSA private key not found
"westnet-eastnet" #1: unable to locate my private key for RSA Signature

It should try the public key's ckaid instead?
