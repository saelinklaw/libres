Basic pluto test using IPv6 (and NETKEY):

This is a host-host connection using tunnel mode between road and east

1) road ping6's from its public ip to the east public ip
2) road adds an ip6table rule to block icmp
3) road pings again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) road initiates connection "v6-tunnel"; east responds
5) icmp packets flow from road to east and are not dropped when encrypted
