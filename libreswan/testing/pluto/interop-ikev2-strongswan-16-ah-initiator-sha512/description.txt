An interop test of Authenticated Header (AH) using sha2_512

This uses IKEv2. It requires netkey

This test requires strongswan 5.1.1 or newer for AH support.

As of strongswan-5.5.2 is performs AH alignment differently, and the kernel
doesn't support either alignment. Requires an update to libreswan
