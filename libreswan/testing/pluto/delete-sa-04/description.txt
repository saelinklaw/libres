Test for ikev1 delete/notify send from responder.

This test uses auto=start on east and auto=add on west,
so that west can become the "responder" to send the --down
command.

If a delete is received within a short margin of a replace timer,
the delete is ignored as a "duplicate" delete, and there is a traffic
flow issue for a while. About a minute later things re-establish.

This looks to be a bug introduced in openswan-1.0.0, see the "Angus patch"
