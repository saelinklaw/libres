Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.
It uses certificates, and both ends have each others certificate preloaded.

IKE does not depend on CERT/CERTREQ payloads. This test should not be
used as model for PKIX validation based tests.

This also tests having public keys loaded from certificates, but not
use the DN as the ID.  Pluto also loads the public key in the certificate
file with the name given.

This is called "out of bound PKIX", as the certificates are not sent in-band.
