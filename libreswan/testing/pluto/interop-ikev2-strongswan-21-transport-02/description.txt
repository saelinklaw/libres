This tests a mismatch of transport vs tunnel mode.

The RFC says that if transport is not supported, tunnel should be used.

libreswan refuses to use tunnel mode when transport mode is configured.

this connection is expected to fail, but strongswan will actually install
a tunnel mode sa and believe the tunnel is up. libreswan will reject the
IKE_AUTH reply from strongswan
