basic OE test, using road and east triggered by packet using NETKEY on road

this test is identical to newoe-2 except that it uses NETKEY.

It uses negotiationshunt=pass and failureshunt=pass for private-or-clear
and packetdefault

This also triggers OE to 7.7.7.7, so that we can test it shows a
proper %pass during/after IKE failure with opportunistic.

keyingtries=1 in private-or-clear to trigger faster IKE failure

unlike the KLIPS testcase, packetflow for 7.7.7.7 works properly with
the %pass.
