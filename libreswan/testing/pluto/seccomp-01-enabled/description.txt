Basic pluto test with seccomp enabled.

This test fails when using namespaces because auditd does not
yet have support for namespaces.

Once established and disconnected, we run the seccomp
test to confirm pluto died.

If this test shows mangled output, it means a cryptohelper
was shot - pluto still lives - and it managed to continue.
That should be considered a bug.

The only SECCOMP entry that should show up in the audit log is
the one for set_sid, (currently 124 but could change over time)

Use /usr/bin/scmp_sys_resolver to match number -> name
