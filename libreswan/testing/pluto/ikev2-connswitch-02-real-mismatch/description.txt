Test connection switching on east with two roadwarrior type conns,
with different IDs and different authby policy

This is a negative test of https://bugs.libreswan.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301

The incoming connection _does_ have a different authby= and the connection
MUST NOT switch to it. There is no other connection that can be used and
so this second connection MUST fail.
