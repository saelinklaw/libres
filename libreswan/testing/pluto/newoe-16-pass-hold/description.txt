basic OE test, using road and east triggered by packet using NETKEY
On road east is in private-or-clear, so IKE will be initiated.
On east road is in clear-or-private, so it will respond to IKE, but
east is impaired with --impair-send-no-ikev2-auth causing IKE to fail.

road has in private-or-clear:

   failureshunt=passthrough
   negotiationshunt=hold

and east has those values in clear-or-private

So when road pings at fist, packets should be hold using negotiationshunt.
After 1m (default retransmit-timeout), IKE has failed and the failureshunt
should be installed, meaning pings will flow unencrypted.
