Test CREATE_CHILD_SA Child SA created by the original responder(west).

East initiate the IKE SA + child SA.  Then West initiate the second
child SA.

East and west have two connections. The east has one of them with
auto=start.
So east is the original IKE initiator in this case.
The west will add a second child connection. It is the initiator of
CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange. Both Child SAs will share the IKE SA.
