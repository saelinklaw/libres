basic OE test, using road and east triggered by packet using NETKEY on road

This test has policies so that east and road have each other in private-or-clear,
and each one will want to do OE. With negotiationshunt=pass, this means both
ends will startup OE based on the ping packet.

We should end up with one OE tunnel, and no crash :/
