<para>What to do with packets during the IKE negotiation.
Valid options are <emphasis remap='B'>hold</emphasis> (the default)
or <emphasis remap='B'>passthrough</emphasis>. This should almost
always be left to the default hold value to avoid cleartext packet
leaking. The only reason to set this to passthrough is if plaintext
service availability is more important than service security or privacy,
a scenario that also implies failureshunt=passthrough and most likely
authby=%null using Opportunistic Encryption.
