<para>The time in seconds until the NETKEY/XFRM acquire state times out. The default value is 30 seconds.
For auto=ondemand connections and Opportunistic connections an IPsec policy is installed in the
kernel. If an incoming or outgoing packet matches this policy, a state is created in the kernel
and the kernel sends an ACQUIRE message to the IKE daemon pluto. While this state is in place,
no new acquires will come in for this connection. The default should be fine for most people.
One use case of shortening these is if opportunistc encryption is used towards cloud instances
that can quickly re-use IP addresses. This value is only used during the libreswan startup
process by the ipsec _stackmanager helper. See also
