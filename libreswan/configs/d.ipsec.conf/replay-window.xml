<para>The size of the IPsec SA replay window protection. The default is kernel stack
specific, but usually 32. Linux NETKEY/XFRM allows at least up to 2048. A value of
of 0 disables replay protection. Disabling of replay protection is sometimes used on
a pair of IPsec servers in a High Availability setup, or on servers with very
unpredictable latency, such as mobile networks, which can cause an excessive amount
of out of order packets. Sequence errors can be seen in /proc/net/xfrm_stat.

Note that technically, at least the Linux kernel can install IPsec SA's
with an IPsec SA Sequence Number, but this is currently not supported
by libreswan.
