IKE padding is allowed in IKEv1 but has been known to cause
interoperability issues. The ikepad= option can be used to disable IKEv1
padding. This used to be required for some devices (such as Checkpoint
in Aggressive Mode) that reject padded IKEv1 packets. A bug was fixed
in libreswan 3.25 that applied wrong IKE padding in XAUTH, so it is
suspected that Checkpoint padding issue bas been resolved. And this
option should not be needed by anyone. In IKEv2, no padding is allowed,
and this option has no effect. If you find a device that seems to
require IKE padding, please contact the libreswan developers.
This option should almost never be enabled and might be removed in a
future version.
