This option is used to create "Routing based VPNs" (as opposed to "Policy based
VPNs"). It will create a new interface that can be used to route traffic
in for encryption/decryption. The Virtual Tunnel Interface
("VTI") interface name is used to for all IPsec SA's created by
this connection. This requires that the connection also enables either
the <emphasis remap='B'>mark=</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>mark-in= /
mark-out-</emphasis> option(s). All traffic marked with the proper MARKs
will be automatically encrypted if there is an IPsec SA policy covering the
source/destination traffic. Tools such as tcpdump and iptables can be
used on all cleartext pre-encrypt and post-decrypt traffic on the device.
See the libreswan wiki for example configurations that use VTI.

<para>
VTI interfaces are currently only supported on Linux with XFRM/NETKEY. The
_updown script handles certain Linux specific interfaces settings
required for proper functioning (disable_policy, rp_filter,
forwarding, etc). Interface names are limited to 16 characters and
may not allow all characters to be used. If marking and <emphasis
remap='I'>vti-routing=yes</emphasis> is used, no manual iptables should
be required. However, administrators can use the iptables mangle table
to mark traffic manually if desired.

<para>
Whether or not to add network rules or routes for IPsec
SA's to the respective VTI devices. Valid values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> (the default) or <emphasis
remap='B'>no</emphasis>. When using "routing based VPNs" with a
subnets policy of 0.0.0.0/0, this setting needs to set to <emphasis
remap='I'>no</emphasis> to prevent imploding the tunnel, and the
administrator is expected to manually add ip rules and ip routes to
configure what traffic must be encrypted. When set to <emphasis remap='I'>yes</emphasis>,
the _updown script will automatically route the leftsubnet/rightsubnet traffic into the
VTI device specified with <emphasis remap='I'>vti-interface</emphasis>

<para>
Whether or not the VTI device is shared amongst connections.
Valid values are <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) or <emphasis
remap='B'>yes</emphasis>. When set to no, the VTI device is automatically
deleted if the connection is a single non-instantiated connection. If a
connection instantiates (eg right=%any) then this option has no effect, as
the VTI device is not removed as it is shared with multiple roadwarriors.
