<para>If pluto is instructed to log to a file using  <emphasis remap='B'>logfile=</emphasis>,
this option determines whether the log file should be appended to or overwritten. Valid options are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> (the default) to append and <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
to overwrite. Since on modern systems, pluto is restarted by other daemons, such as systemd,
this option should be left at its default yes value to preserve the log entries of previous
runs of pluto. The option is mainly of use for running the test suite, which needs to create
new log files from scratch.
