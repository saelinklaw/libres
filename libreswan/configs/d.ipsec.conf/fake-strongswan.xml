<para>whether to send a STRONGSWAN Vendor ID payload to the peer.
Acceptable values are: <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis> (the default) and
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>.
This used to be required because strongswan rejects certain proposals with private use numbers such as
esp=twofish or esp=serpent unless it receives a strongswan vendorid by
the peer. This option sends such an (unversioned) vendor id. Note that libreswan and strongswan
no longer support twofish or serpent, so enabling this option likely will no longer do anything.
