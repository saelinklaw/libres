IKEv1 fragmentation capabilities are negotiated via a well-known private
<emphasis remap='I'>vendor id</emphasis>. IKEv2 fragmentation support is implemented
using RFC 7383. If pluto does not receive the fragmentation payload, no IKE fragments will
be sent, regardless of the fragmentation= setting. When set to
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>, IKE fragmentation will be attempted
on the first re-transmit of an IKE packet of a size larger then 576 bytes for
IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.
If fragmentation is set to force, IKE fragmentation is used on initial transmits of
such sized packets as well.
When we have received IKE fragments for a connection, pluto behaves as if in
force mode.
