<para>how many <emphasis remap='I'>pluto helpers</emphasis> are started
to help with cryptographic operations. Pluto will start as many helpers as
the number of CPU's, minus 1 to dedicate to the main thread.  For machines
with less than 4 CPU's, an equal number of helpers to CPU's are started.
A value of 0 forces pluto to do all operations inline using the main
process. A value of -1 tells pluto to perform the above calculation. Any
other value forces the number to that amount.
