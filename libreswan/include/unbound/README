This directory is only picked up by make if compiled with USE_UNBOUND_EVENT_H_COPY=true

A bug in "make install" in unbound when compiled with libevent support results in the
file unbound-event.h not getting installed. This bug is present in unbound up to at
least 1.6.0. The required functions are properly exposed in the shared library.

Setting USE_UNBOUND_EVENT_H_COPY=true results in this include file being used to work
around this bug. It has only been tested against unbound 1.6.x
